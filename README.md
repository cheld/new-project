# Allianz Open Source Template

This project template can be used to create the skeleton of a new open source project.

## Why should I use this template?

* Speed up the project initialization
* Comply with [community standards](https://opensource.guide/starting-a-project/#launching-your-own-open-source-project)
* Achieve a positive contributor experience

## Usage


Open Github in a browser and click the button `Use this template`. It will copy the content to your own repository. The commit history of this project will be removed. Alternatively, you can copy & paste the content of individual files. 

All files include instructions that are only visible when viewing the file in raw mode or as text. 
All files need to be adapted to the concrete project needs. Search for TODOs. More instructions can be found on the pages of the [Allianz OSPO](opensource.allianz.com)<!--TODO-->.
